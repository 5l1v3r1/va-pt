The set of scripts included in this package will create a Kali/SamuraiWTF type environment for the performing of Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Testing.

The goal of this project was to allow a portable set of tools to be installed onto an Ubuntu or Raspbian system, allowing the tester to be free of distribution release specific constraints.

These scripts were designed specifically for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Raspbian.

Contents of the package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
deps.sh - Contains the necessary software dependencies for the tools within the kit to function.
exploits.sh - Contains the scripts to download various exploit code from public sources
static.sh - Downloads static applications which are not svn capable
svn.sh - SVN repository scripts to checkout and update the various tools
wordlists.sh - Contains the scripts to download the various wordlists from public sources
update-tools.sh - update script for all the tools that have git/svn functionality or that I created an update script for.
install.sh - The script that makes it all happen
readme - You're looking at it
search/ - the PHP Files for the local vulnerability and exploitdb search interface
rasp-pi/ - Scripts directory for the Raspberry PI

All tools are loaded into the /pentest directory.

How To
------
To start, run the installer: sudo ./install.sh
Install the dependencies first via option 1) Install/Check Dependencies
Once the deps scripts has completed, walk through the remaining install options. Install the SVN tools, statics tools, exploit code repo's (packetstorm and exploitdb) and finally the wordlists. Option 6 installs a web based vulnerability/exploit portal, not required but you may find it makes things easier when searching for exploits or vulnerabilities.

--Setup for postgres DB 
sudo su postgres
psql
create user <username with password 'password' createdb;
create database msf owner <your username>;
\q
./msfconsole
db_connect <username>:<password>@localhost/msf

Add the db_connect statement into the msfconsole file for simplicity
-- .msf4/msfconsole.rc
-- db_connect username:password@localhost:port/msf

If you are running, or are planning on running, Nexpose on the same system. You will need to change the listening port on the postgresql database.

/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf

An installer for the Raspberry PI has been added. The installer was created specifically for the Raspbian distro. All Pi scripts can be found in va-pt/rasp-pi directory. I would strongly recommend installing the PI kit to a single PI then dd'ing the card to an image. After that, use the image to write the additional PI's.

PI Image Creation Example
-------------------------
Use gparted to shrink the PI image once you have the initial card completed. Using DD, create the image 

sudo dd if=/dev/sdc bs=4M | pv -s 8G | sudo dd of=penpi.img bs=4M

After the image has completed, use fdisk and truncate to remove the unallocated space

$ fdisk -lu penpi.img 

Disk penpi.img: 31.9 GB, 31914983424 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 3880 cylinders, total 62333952 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x0002c262

    Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
penpi.img1            8192      122879       57344    c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)
penpi.img2          122880    20762623    10319872   83  Linux

$ sudo truncate --size=$[(20762623+1)*512] penpi.img 

Wireless Testing
----------------
if you are having issues with Hostapd-WPE where you are getting errors on startup similar to the following:

Configuration file: hostapd-wpe.conf
rfkill: WLAN hard blocked
rfkill: WLAN hard blocked
nl80211: Could not configure driver mode
nl80211 driver initialization failed.
hostapd_free_hapd_data: Interface wlan0 wasn't started

Issue both of the following commands to remediate the errors:

sudo nmcli nm wifi off
sudo rfkill unblock wlan
